Partial emulator for Sperry Univac 1100/80 mainframe

This work is just beginning - there's nothing to see here (yet!)

(EDIT:  Yes, I know this repo has been sitting here, unpopulated, for
several years.  I wish this were not the case...  My primary issue with
making any progress on this is, I have nothing to run on it - so even
if I were to implement something, I have no way to even guess if it's
working or not.  I do have a hobbyist distribution [directly from
Unisys and everything] of OS2200, but I do not know if it will run
on the 1100/80 configuration I want to target with this project.  If
I can someday find an old OS1100 IPL tape, I'm much more likely to
make progress on this....)
